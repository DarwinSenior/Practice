practice of small games

I did this before I start my college studying.
These codes are inspired by Jave 2D games tutorial from zetcode.com.
=====================================

I want to practice the idea of OOP and basic game.
The basic structure is all the same.
Board class is responsible for controller and view while Model class is responsible for models.
I found Java a very good tools for practicing the idea of OOP.

=====================================
Tetris is my first game. I did do a pause and the basic function.
key up for rotate, left and right for moving horizontally, down for dropping, and key p for pause and resume.
I did not wrote the game over because I am too lasy.

=====================================
Maze is my second, it is the simplist version
You move from the most left top to the right bottom and start over again.
